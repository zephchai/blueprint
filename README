#### Golden Rules ####
- ALL codes should be written in English
- ALWAYS test your code before pushing it up to origin
- If you are unsure whether your code will work in remote site, get the TD there
  to test the code for you. Or use teamviewer to test it.
- DO NOT hardcode any path or similar variables in your code
- Use config file to provide site/project specific settings
- Use .gitignore to exclude files that should not be checked into git
- Copy the hooks\pre-commit hooks to your .git\hooks folder in your repository

#### Git usage ####
git add <file> - Add a new file that is not part of the repository
git pull - Pull the files from origin to your repo. Run this to get updates
git checkout <file> - Checkout a file for editing
git commit <file> - Commit your changes into your repo. Think of this as save.
git push - Push your commit up to the origin
